# How to Handle File Uploads 

The `uploads` directory is intended for local development purposes of how file uploads are handled in this E-Commerce application.

**Current Implementation (Local Storage):**

Currently, this application is configured to store uploaded files directly within the server's local file system in this `uploads/` directory. This is typically achieved using a Node.js middleware like `multer`.
